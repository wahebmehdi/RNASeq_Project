# TRPC6 Inhibition in Breast Cancer Stem Cells (RNA-seq DEA)

This repository contains the code and results of a comprehensive RNA-seq data analysis project that investigates the effect of TRPC6 inhibition in Breast Cancer Stem Cells (BCSC) enriched models. The primary goal of this analysis is to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) associated with TRPC6 inhibition in the context of BCSCs.

## Project Highlights

- **Data Source:** RNA-seq data from the GEO database (Accession: GSE242592)
- **Experimental Design:** Time-course experiment treating cells with a TRPC6 inhibitor for 6 and 12 hours, with DMSO as a control for the respective time points.
- **Genomic Scope:** Focuses on Homo sapiens (human) and is of medical relevance.

## Repository Contents

- **Scripts:** Contains R scripts used for data loading, quality control, normalization, and differential gene expression analysis.
- **Data:** Includes the original "COUNT" data and metadata used in the analysis.
- **Plots:** Features generated plots and visualizations to aid in the interpretation of DEGs.
- **Results:** Contains summary reports and findings from the analysis.
- **README:** This file provides an introduction to the project, explanations of the analysis steps, and contact information.

## Usage
